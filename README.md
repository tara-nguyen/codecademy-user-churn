# Project Assignment: User Churn
###

Codeflix, a streaming video startup, is interested in measuring their user churn rate. In this project, youâ€™ll be helping them answer these questions about their churn:
- How many months has the company been operating? Which months do you have enough information to calculate a churn rate? What segments of users exist?
- What is the overall churn trend since the company started?
- Compare the churn rates between user segments. Which segment of users should the company focus on expanding?

The dataset contains one SQL table, `subscriptions`. Within the table, there are 4 columns:
- `id` - the subscription id
- `subscription_start` - the start date of the subscription
- `subscription_end` - the end date of the subscription
- `segment` - this identifies which segment the subscription owner belongs to

Codeflix requires a minimum subscription length of 31 days, so a user can never start and end their subscription in the same month.

The first 20 rows in `subscriptions` look like this:

id | subscription_start | subscription_end | segment
